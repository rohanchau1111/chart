To deploy a simple application in Kubernetes using Minikube, including a pod and a service of type LoadBalancer, and then access it through your browser, follow these steps.

1. Create a Pod YAML Definition
Let's start by creating a Pod that runs a simple NGINX container.
# service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30007 # You can choose any port in the range 30000-32767
  type: NodePort

yaml
Copy code
# pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
2. Create a Service of Type LoadBalancer
Now, create a Service that exposes the Pod using type LoadBalancer.

yaml
Copy code
# service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
3. Apply the YAML Files
You need to apply both the pod.yaml and service.yaml files to your Kubernetes cluster using the kubectl command.

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
4. Minikube Setup for LoadBalancer Access
Since Minikube doesn’t directly support LoadBalancer services out of the box (as it’s usually for cloud environments), we need to enable Minikube's built-in tunneling feature to simulate a load balancer.

Run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
minikube tunnel
This command will create a tunnel for services of type LoadBalancer and provide a local IP that you can access.

5. Get the Service URL
To get the IP address and port that Minikube has assigned for the LoadBalancer service, use this command:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get service nginx-service
The output will look something like this:

bash
Copy code
NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
nginx-service   LoadBalancer   10.96.78.15     10.0.2.15       80:31234/TCP   5m
The EXTERNAL-IP (e.g., 10.0.2.15) is the address you can use to access the service from your browser.

6. Access the Application in the Browser
If you are using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), Minikube runs inside the WSL, so you may need to make sure the network is accessible from your Windows environment.

You can check the Minikube IP by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
minikube ip
Once you have the Minikube IP, append the port you got from the kubectl get service command. For example, if the IP is 10.0.2.15 and the port is 31234, you would access:

arduino
Copy code
http://10.0.2.15:31234
Additional Step for WSL
If you encounter issues accessing the Minikube IP from your browser in Windows, you can expose the IP to Windows by using the following command on the WSL terminal:

bash
Copy code
minikube service nginx-service --url
This will give you a direct URL to access the service in the browser. Copy that URL and open it in your Windows browser.

By following these steps, you should be able to run a Kubernetes pod with a service and access it via the browser using Minikube running in WSL.
